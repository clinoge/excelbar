# The letter

The night was pitch black, stars covered the sky as the cloaked
men entered the ruins that once were the big city of Xoria.

Known for the moor that surrounded it and extended far beyond
the gaze, the city was located on the west side of Excelbar, high
up on the mountains. The moor, although surrounding it, grew mostly
to its west.

The cloaked man entered the city cautiously, holding their breath as
much as they possibly could. No one had been there for at least six
years, ever since the Edowin calamity had begun. Nilo still reminded
their initial approach and later retreat to the moor. The fire on the
mountains, the decided words of Erixia, the scared voice of Alevio...

All of it seemed so far away, so much had happened since. They kept
walking, up until the center of the city, where all the local government
was placed, and then some more down what had been the poor districts.
The scenery couldn't be more haunting. Everything was utterly destroyed,
skeletons covered in snows laid unburied everywhere. Only the blood had
been washed down by the continuous process of nature - a reminder that
time hadn't stopped.

Finally, they reached the place they were looking for. A savaged tavern,
its structure barely standing. The stories of the people that came there
long forgotten. They slipped in and went through the rotten wooden floor.

Looking up he thought of Erixia. The stars, bright as her stare, gazed
down unto him. They had had a hard time parting, but he couldn't have
refused the Order petition - to her. No matter what happened, she had to
be safe. So he took her place. All that mattered was her, and Alicia.
The goosebumps came softly as he remembered the tears of their daughter
whom oblivious to what was happening could but see the loving father go.

The order had diminished since the massacre of Kyklonas where last maester
had died. The remaining members organized under the lead of his daughter,
Kyra. Whom but briefly addressed them and told everything that was to be
done before marching to parts unknown.

He had been allowed into the secret by petition of Erixia herself. Not to
his surprise they had invited him, for Erixia had opened to him long ago,
just after leaving that damned forest where they lost their friend and
companion.

She told him everything she knew, and started to train him in the ways of
the order. Everything from healing magic to the former history of the realm,
only recorded by them.

"Nilo" the whispering snapped him out of his trance, and reminded him of the
mission.

They reunited along the bar and started chanting, very slowly, as if not to
disturb the dead around them. A mark then shined faintly on the floor and
the floor opened to reveal a staircase. The Order's Xoria post still remained.
Down they went, swallowed by darkness as the floor rearranged itself.

It was quite hard to walk down the steps without any light, but any form of
magic was forbidden. The Edowin had cast casted a detection charm under most
of Excelbar by now, and they couldn't risk it. Old charms, however, couldn't
be detected, however times activated. Strange measure not to have one for
lights, but humans they were, and they had overlooked far worse things.

The passage went down for what seemed to be miles, and the descent was slow.
No sound but the one of their cloaks was to be heard for hours.

At last, they reached a wall.

"Eros aux balonis" Nilo spoke and the wall disappeared to reveal an opening.
Candles lit up as the six of them entered the room. A look around told them
the post hadn't gone through the madness above without taking a hit. The
whole thing was messy, some walls seemed just about to crumble under the
weight they carried.

Their mission here was simple. Naught but resting and retrieving what they
could of the order papers, then part on the morrow to the eastern mountain
range and then go north to the city where it all started, Erexit.

For months they had waited for orders, down the refugees built under the
mountains. Patiently they organized and started living of anything they
could find. The hardest part was harvesting, but they finally managed to
produce artificial sunlight by combining magical minerals and started to
grow anything that the expeditionary groups could bring.

Though the Order's actions were still unknown to people, the secret of its
existence was no more. The new government, in lieu of a better word, was
formed by them. No one knew more about the Edowin, no one knew better how
to survive unseen. There was no resistance, there was no hatred, the common
enemy united them all.

At first every community worked hard to build a place where they could live,
no expeditions were to be performed - though they were. A year passed by
where small "towns" raised under the mountains, spread across the realm.
Organization was hard enough without enemies, let alone in the presence of
those cursed beasts. But they managed to do it, part of it thanks to the
reduced population.

Then they started reaching out. Expeditionary groups were established. Their
mission at first but only one, to look for other survivors. Then the Order's
hand started to take more control, and hope started to raise as the missions
changed. Now they were researching for ways to end this madness, to fight the
demons that took everything they loved.

Tragedies occurred, of course. The Edowin sometimes tracked down their location
and massacred everyone that couldn't get away. Reminding everyone that hell
was but a few foots above them. Whole expeditionary groups were erased, not to
be heard of anymore, best case scenario their reminders found and brought back.

Thus had been the fate of the last two expeditionary groups sent to Erexit. Word
had come about two months ago. It was time for the Kuhle May community to step
in. And they had.

Nilo entered the maester room while the others went through other rooms and
started to look through the archives and parchments. Nothing caught his
attention. There wasn't nothing new there. A small note on the desk, hurriedly
written, told whoever would look at it, that they went up as soon as the steps
were heard. Probably fought bravely til the very end, for no member of the Xoria
post had reported so far, and five years was a long time.

He sat down and thought of Erixia. Tears didn't flow when they parted, but he
knew that she was crying inside. He was, too. They hugged and kissing shortly,
trying to give each other as much hope and love can be given. Then he pressed
his face against the crying Alicia and hugged them both, unable to produce any
words, just about to burst into tears. Love kept them united. Love separated
them. What a cruel thing - he thought. But if he wanted Alicia to see the
sunlight on her own, playing without fear on a field filled with flowers, if
he wanted Erixia to run after her, with nothing but tears of joy, he had to
do his best, as Erixia did. Future depended on their actions, now more than
ever.

He thought of the morrow, when they would part. Two of them would go back to
inform of the success, the other four - including him - would go on til the
very end. Then it occurred to him.

"Erixia" - he started writing - "We've reached Xoria" then doubtfully stared
at the blank parchment. He wasn't good with words. He'd never been.

"It's been a quiet trip. No giants to be seen. I'm writing to you from the
post. It needs a bit of painting here and there, but otherwise it's lovely.
Right now the guys are looking for anything edible and going through the
small library, though I doubt that they'll find either.

Xoria, of course, needs a bit more than a new painting. The whole city is
in dear need of a redecoration. I think we'll leave in the morning, the
whole atmosphere is way too unwelcoming.

I think of you two every day, every hour, every minute. Give Alicia a hug
and tell her I'll come back with some purple flower seeds, the ones that
she likes so much, and we'll grow them in a little garden. It's been a
month, yet I miss you so much as if years had passed by."

He didn't want to sound worried, nor sad. Erixia had enough with staying
back and waiting - something she hadn't done in a while - and he knew
the feeling all too well.

"I love you, I love you so much Erixia. Please, be safe. Both of you.
I'll come back as soon as I can and then we'll..."

He stopped dead.

"Nilo" Erixia voice filled the place "We've been discovered".

It was a nightmare. It had to be.

"We're leaving, there's little time, but enough to make it." she tried
her best to make her voice sound convincing, but he could note she was
scared to death.

"Erixia...!" he couldn't manage it, his voice came out full of horror.

"Nilo, we're good. I didn't like the painting anyways. I don't know
where we will be heading, but I'll find a way to let you know..."

"Erixia...!" the ground started to tremble, they had been discovered
too. But something was off, the times didn't fit. Even if they had
casted magic as strong as this, the Edowin shouldn't been able to tell
were they were for another hour or so.

"Take care Nilo, please! I love you, be safe, promise, come back!"

His men on the door, struck with horror as the voice faded. It took
him a second to absorb what was happening. The refuge had been discovered,
as they had been. Erixia and Alicia were in danger, as they were. He had
to make a call.

"Orel, you take the lead, I'm going back." a blue circle surrounded them.
Magic was finally allowed.

"Nilo, you can't" Orel placed a hand on his shoulder, he was trembling
"We are not supposed to. We can't. It won't make a difference, they not
putting a fight, you know it as well as I do"

He was right, of course. Orel had a colder head. Nilo knew he was right,
but his thoughts were only of Erixia and Alicia, not of right or wrong.

"I said I'm going back!" the blue circle was closing, its light growing.

"YOU CAN'T" Orel's face was contorted, he too had a family back "WE CAN'T"

"OF COURSE WE CAN" earth screamed, the Edowin had to be just above them,
the ceiling seemed about to fall apart with the tremor "WE CAN AND WE'RE
GOING TO"

"NO WE'RE NOT" Orel gave him a punch full on the face "NO WE'RE NOT, WE'RE
GOING TO EREXIT AND WE'RE BRINGING THESE FUCKERS DOWN OR ELSE WE'RE DOOMED".

The circle finally closed around them and bursted. For a second they could
but feel the suffocating sensation of traveling through magic.

Then the sky appeared above them. Orel had his shoulders. The city could be
seen on the distance, shadows moving violently, the sound and the tremor
just a bit lighter.

"NILO FOR FUCKS SAKE, THINK ABOUT IT" Uma stepped in "PLEASE, THERE IS NO
HELPING, WE CAN'T TRAVEL THAT FAR BY MAGIC, YOU'RE GOING TO END DEAD"

"I DON'T CARE I'LL TR..."

"YOU'VE GOT A DAUGHTER, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY DIE YOU... WHAT WILL SHE THINK
UH? YOU WANT HER TO CRY TO YOU OVER SOME MONUMENT TO THE FALLEN? WELL THEN
OFF YOU GO, LEAVE HER YOU COWARD"

His head spinning he imagined the moment, and the vision hit stronger than
the words. The fields with flowers, Erixia running after Alicia. Everything
lost.

"O.." he looked around, everyone's face was full of horror "Ok. We move on"
he tried uttering an apologize but couldn't.

"We're all scared Nilo, but we must" Orel placed his arm on his shoulders.
"We must, for everyone back a Kuhle May"

The sounds stopped. The night was silent once again. The shadows still.

"It won't take long. We must hurry"

Nilo took one last look at the city, then to the west.

"Erixia, please, be alive" a last phrase, thrown to the wind, before they
started to run east, into the territory were the Edowin had the firmest
grasp.
